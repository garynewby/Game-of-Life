Game of Life (iOS)
------------------

A cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
The 4 simple rules below are applied to each cell in the system in passes.
From this the state of each cell is calculated to be alive or dead.

Rules:
1) Any live cell with less than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
2) Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3) Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
